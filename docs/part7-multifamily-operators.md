# Part 7: Wisconsin Multifamily Operators & National REIT Presence | Southeastern Wisconsin Focus

**Date:** 12/24/25 | **Revision:** Rev 0
**Changelog:** Initial research baseline - Wisconsin-specific operators and national REITs with Milwaukee/Wisconsin properties

---

## Executive Summary

This research identifies key multifamily property owners, managers, and developers operating in Wisconsin with specific focus on the Milwaukee metropolitan area. **Key finding: Most major national REITs (AvalonBay, Equity Residential, MAA, UDR, Camden, Essex) have NO Wisconsin presence** — they focus on coastal markets and Sun Belt states. Wisconsin's multifamily market is dominated by regional and local operators, creating relationship-based business development opportunities rather than centralized vendor procurement systems.

### Market Overview
- **AOMA Wisconsin membership**: 100+ companies representing 50,000+ apartment homes across ~200 communities
- **Milwaukee rental market**: ~157,000 rental housing units across ~49,000 landlord-owned parcels
- **Market concentration**: Top 1% of landlord networks own 44% of Milwaukee rental units
- **Average rent**: $1,661/month (Milwaukee metro)
