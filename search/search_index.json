Important update: As of October 2024, U.S. DOT requires recertification of all DBE firms; WisDOT has temporarily paused setting DBE goals for new contracts. Contact [email protected] for recertification status. However, the certification automatically qualifies as TBE for Milwaukee County projects.</p> <p>City of Milwaukee SBE certification provides the most direct bidding advantage: combined with LBE status, contractors receive 10% bid preference on contracts over $50,000. The city requires 25% SBE participation on contracts over $25,000\u2014creating subcontracting opportunities if pursuing larger prime contracts.</p> <p>Wisconsin DHS lead certification represents a significant competitive moat. Wisconsin law requires certification for any renovation, repair, or painting in pre-1978 buildings that disturbs more than 6 square feet of interior or 20 square feet of exterior painted surface. Milwaukee's extensive pre-1978 building stock\u2014including schools, municipal buildings, and public housing\u2014makes this certification essential for substantial contract eligibility.
